# Board Notices Manager for phpBB 3.1

This extension will help you manage various notices at the top of all the pages.

This is not the same as an announcement. An announcement is global, whereas notices are contextual. Also an announcement is dismissable, notices are not.

A few examples:
* Display a message to guests asking them to register
* Display a happy birthday message on your birthday.
* Display a welcoming message asking you to write an introduction if you never posted yet.
* Congratulations for your 1,000th post
* Congratulations for your 5th year registration anniversary
* Some warning that you're browsing a specific forum (like a read-only section)
* etc.

**Please note this extension is still at the development stage, and is not ready for production**
